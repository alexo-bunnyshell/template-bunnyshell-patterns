## Introduction

Bunnyshell is a powerful tool for creating and managing environments for development, testing, and production. This repository provides ready-to-use environment templates and code snippets to help you implement common design patterns using Bunnyshell. Each template is designed to address specific use cases and can be easily integrated into your projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the templates or code snippets, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bunnyshell-templates.git
    cd bunnyshell-templates
    ```

2. Check out the branch that contains the template or code snippet you need:
    ```bash
    git checkout <branch-name>
    ```

## Branch Structure

Each branch in this repository contains a distinct environment template or design pattern. The branches are structured as follows:

- `main`: Contains the general documentation and overview of the repository.
- `template-<use-case>`: Contains a specific environment template for a particular use case.
- `pattern-<design-pattern>`: Contains code snippets demonstrating a particular design pattern.

### Example Branches

- `template-basic-app`: Basic application environment template.
- `template-microservices`: Environment template for a microservices architecture.
- `pattern-blue-green-deployment`: Code snippets demonstrating a blue-green deployment pattern.

## Usage

To use a template or pattern, follow these steps:

1. Check out the desired branch:
    ```bash
    git checkout <branch-name>
    ```

2. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within the branch for setup and configuration.

## Contributing
